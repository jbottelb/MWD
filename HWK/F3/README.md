# Superlative Voter website

The purpose of the site is to allow users to create forms for their friends to fill out to vote who should get each award. Awards such as "Most likely to succeed" or "best hair". These are also called paper plate awards. 

## Status
Right now the site acts to show how a form would work, and display some understanding of the framework to develop it. Lots of this needs to be moved around to give a user an experiance that would be intuituve and actually functional. I believe the site fufills all the requirements to make points for feature 3, but it is still a long ways from a working model. \
In the next feature, with routing, some different sites will be added, like the log in/sign up, creating a form cite, voting on an existing form and checking the status (who is winning what, and give the host the ability to close the form and maybe even email the results). 

Authentification will allow users to keep thier forms private and only allow certain people to access and vote on forms. 

Most functionality will be delievered once data is in a database of a sort instead of a json file.
